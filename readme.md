# Instructions

To run this project it is best to have eclipse installed, and JDK 7. Using eclipse, import all three of the folders:

- ggj2014

1. right click on the ggj2014-desktop folder on the left
2. click export
3. Under the java folder, select Runnable Jar
4. From the launch config, select the Main for the desktop project
5. Browse to an export directory
6. Ensure the option 'Extract required libraries into generated JAR' is selected
7. Click Finish
8. Then double click the compiled JAR to run the game.
